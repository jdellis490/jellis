# Personal Portfolio

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create something on my own using the skills that I have learned from my class. I built this project because it allowed me to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS and apply them to make a portfolio that I can modify/use throughout the course. I learned that it takes a lot of work going into a project working from scratch, and this project made me realize my own limitations to which I need to overcome.
